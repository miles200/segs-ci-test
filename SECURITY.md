# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If there are any vulnerability in the **SEGS** project or any of it's sub-projects, don't hesitate to _report them_.

Until we officialy release the non-alpha version, we welcome all security reports as a publically visible github issues. 

- If you have a fix, explain or attach it.
